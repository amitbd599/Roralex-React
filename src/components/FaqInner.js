                    It was the cultures of the great river valleys—including the
                    Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus, and the Huang
                    Ho—with their intensive agriculture based on irrigation—that
                    developed the first communities large enough to be called
                    cities. These cities were built with a new building
                    technology, based on the clay available on the riverbanks.
                    The packed clay walls of earlier times were replaced by
                    those constructed of prefabricated units: mud bricks. This
                    represented a major conceptual change from the free forms of
                    packed clay to the geometric modulation imposed by the
                    rectangular brick, and the building plans too became
                    strictly rectangular.
