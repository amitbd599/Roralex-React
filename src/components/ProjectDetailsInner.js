                        Construction planning is a fundamental and challenging
                        activity in the management and execution of construction
                        projects. It involves the choice of technology, the
                        definition of work tasks, the estimation of the required
                        resources and durations for individual tasks, and the
                        identification of any interactions among the different
                        work tasks.

                      Like a detective, a planner begins with a result (i.e. a
                      facility design) and must synthesize the steps required to
                      yield this result. Essential aspects of construction
                      planning include the generation of required activities,
                      analysis of the implications of these activities, and
                      choice among the various alternative means of performing
                      activities. In contrast to a detective discovering a
                      single train of events, however, construction planners
                      also face the normative problem of choosing the best among
                      numerous alternative plans. Moreover, a detective is faced
                      with an observable result, whereas a planner must imagine
                      the final facility as described in the plans and
                      specifications. Like a detective, a planner begins with a
